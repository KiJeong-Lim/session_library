# How to run the scripts
The scripts will generate files of the following structure 
{config}/{workload}/{session_semantic}/{trial_number}/{run_number}

To run the plot files you can run average.py to condense the values of the run_numbers 

# ToDo
1. Automatically perform the average and then do the graphs in the run.sh
